# zorp's own arXiv paper is about the harness, not a discovery it made

**Decision:** The paper zorp itself publishes to arXiv is a systems paper
describing zorp: its minimal-harness design, its lineage from quecto, and
its evals/benchmarks (including comparisons against heavier frameworks
like Sakana's AI-Scientist-v2 and Aviskaar's own lab-engine/Catalyst
pipeline). It is not a scientific-discovery paper produced by using zorp
to research some unrelated topic.

**Why:** Stated directly. This scopes `docs/paper/` and keeps it separate
from the product itself: what zorp offers users (validate an idea, run
experiments, co-write a paper, find a venue) is general-purpose and not
about zorp. What zorp publishes about itself is a tools paper, the same
genre as the papers describing AI-Scientist-v2 or other agent harnesses.

**Ruled out:** Treating "zorp writes a research paper" as meaning zorp
needs to autonomously produce a novel scientific result end to end before
it counts as done. That's a much larger, different bar than a systems
paper needs, and conflating the two would have quietly inflated scope.
