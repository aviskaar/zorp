# Harness renamed from quecto to zorp

**Decision:** All crates, binaries, env vars, and CLI/log strings renamed
from `quecto*` / `QUECTO_*` to `zorp*` / `ZORP_*`. quecto's own historical
docs (changelog, UAT reports, issue log) moved to `docs/upstream-quecto/`
and left untouched, since they document quecto's own history under its
own name.

**Why:** Deferred at bootstrap time on purpose (see the entry below), then
done once the base harness was in place and it was clear what was
actually being kept versus rebuilt.
