# validate's design: MCP-only search, two-dimension rubric, new embedding env var

**Decision:** `validate` searches through whatever search-capable MCP
servers the user has configured, no built-in search provider. Embeddings
for LanceDB come from a new `ZORP_EMBEDDING_MODEL` env var, hitting the
same `ZORP_BASE_URL` the chat model already uses. Scoring uses two
domain-agnostic dimensions, redundancy (has this already been answered)
and feasibility (can this be investigated), not Catalyst's four
academic-specific dimensions, each requiring a citation from retrieved
evidence or scoring 0.

**Why:** No built-in search provider keeps zorp vendor-neutral and
avoids owning an API key/provider zorp would have to maintain; MCP
already exists for exactly this. Reusing `ZORP_BASE_URL` for embeddings
matches how the rest of zorp is configured, one new env var instead of a
new provider abstraction. Two dimensions instead of four because
"novelty" and "prior-art distance" don't mean anything for a Kafka
migration question; redundancy and feasibility do, for any domain.

**Ruled out:** Shipping a default search provider (scope creep for a
first version, and a provider decision zorp shouldn't own). A structured
sources table (citations as free text for now; revisit only if
co-write's claim-check needs more).
