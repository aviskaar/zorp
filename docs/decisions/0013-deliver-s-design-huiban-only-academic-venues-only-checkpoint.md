# deliver's design: huiban-only, academic venues only, checkpoint doesn't kill the track

**Decision:** `deliver` is scoped to academic venue-matching only for v1,
not the broader "right format for any audience" language used elsewhere.
It requires a `draft.md` (from `co-write`) and a huiban-prefixed MCP
tool to be configured, checked the same way `validate` requires a
search-capable tool. The agent uses huiban to find and rank real
conferences and journals fitting the draft's scope, writes the shortlist
to `venues.md`, and checkpoints it. Rejecting the checkpoint does not
kill the track, matching `co-write`'s behavior, not `validate`'s or
`investigate`'s.

**Why:** A non-academic artifact has no equivalent of a "venue" in the
same concrete sense a paper does, and a generic reformatting mechanism
for arbitrary audiences is a different, larger problem than a first
version needs to solve. Requiring huiban specifically, rather than
falling back to generic search, avoids weak or fabricated venue matches
from a tool not built for this. Not killing the track on rejection
matches `co-write`'s reasoning: a shortlist not being good enough isn't
evidence anything upstream failed.

**Ruled out:** A general "format for any audience" mechanism for
non-academic artifacts (would need its own design if it becomes a real
need, not a bolt-on here). A shipped, static venue catalog (already
ruled out earlier in the decision log). Falling back to generic web
search when huiban isn't configured.
