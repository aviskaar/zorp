# two data stores, split by job, not one general-purpose one

**Decision:** DuckDB for the transactional and analytical record (the
run record: experiment status, stage transitions, metrics as structured
columns), LanceDB for multimodal, semantically searchable content
(literature embeddings, paper text and figures, plots, anything the
validate and find-a-venue capabilities need to search over by meaning
rather than by exact field).

**Why:** They're solving different problems. DuckDB's `duckdb-rs` is
synchronous, modeled on the same interface as `rusqlite` (which
`zorp-agent` already uses for session persistence), with full transaction
support, and it's also a real analytical engine, so aggregating metrics
across many experiment attempts is a native strength, not an afterthought
the way it would be on a plain OLTP store. LanceDB is embedded, built on
Arrow, and handles vector similarity, full-text, and multimodal data
(text, images) in one store, which is exactly what novelty checks and
venue matching need. Neither is a hard dependency on Aviskaar-private
infrastructure; both are embedded, no server, ship inside zorp itself.

**Ruled out:** One store trying to do both jobs. A vector database
forced to also be the transactional state machine, or a relational store
pressed into semantic search, would compromise on whichever job it does
second-best. This also supersedes an earlier verbal suggestion to reuse
`rusqlite` for the run record; DuckDB was chosen instead for the added
analytical capability.

**Async boundary:** LanceDB's Rust API is async (tokio). `duckdb-rs` is
synchronous. Both live above `zorp` core, same as `zorp-mcp` and the
`otel` feature already do, without touching the core's deliberately
synchronous design.
